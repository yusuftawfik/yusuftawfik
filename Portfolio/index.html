            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="about-text">
                As a youth hailing from a middle-class background,<br>
                I nurtured a persistent intrigue in the conception and realization of websites,<br>
                applications, and games. Commencing this odyssey of discovery at the tender age of ten,<br>
                I delved into books, utilized learning applications, watched instructional videos, and pursued courses,<br>
                all in pursuit of knowledge. Now, at the age of sixteen, I stand enriched,<br>
                having accumulated a wealth of expertise in the domains of website creation, deployment, and fortification.<br>
                Since the age of fourteen, I have fervently immersed myself in project development ventures,<br>
                some of which I proudly exhibit below in the <a href="./project.html" class="body-links">projects</a> section.
            </p>
            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <p>Through five years of diligent study and experimentation, I have honed my expertise in a variety of tools and languages,<br>
                 enabling me to craft sophisticated and reliable web experiences. </p>
            <h3>Front-End</h3>
            <p>In the realm of front-end development, I wield HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with finesse,<br>
                 ensuring elegant and responsive user interfaces.</p><br>
            <p> I leverage advanced libraries and frameworks such as <br>
                React.js, Redux, and Bootstrap to imbue projects with dynamic functionality and polished aesthetics.</p>
            <h3>Back-End</h3>
            <p>On the back end, I employ Express.js and PostgreSQL to construct robust and efficient server-side architecture.<br>
                 This meticulous approach results in websites and web applications that are not only fast and reliable but also secure. </p>
            <p>By integrating these tools and techniques seamlessly,<br>
                 I deliver products that meet the highest standards of performance and user satisfaction,<br>
                  all within the shortest possible time frame.</p>

            In the link below, you can explore a project I undertook as a favor for a friend embarking on an e-commerce venture. <br>
            I developed the website entirely to his personal preferences, aiming to create something truly exceptional. <br>
